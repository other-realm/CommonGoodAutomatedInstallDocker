1. Install Docker for your operating system: https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition 
2. If you do not already have git installed (I.E. you are not a programmer), install git for your OS at: https://git-scm.com/downloads
3.  If you don't have the Chrome browser on your computer, download that at: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html 
4.  Download and unzip: https://github.com/other-realm/CommonGoodAutomatedInstallDocker.git 
5.  Navigate to the folder you just unzipped and download and unzip: https://github.com/other-realm/rcredits-mobile/archive/Stable.zip to that folder
6.  With everything downloaded, run the program: setup.bat if you are in a windows environment or setup.sh otherwise
7.  Once the command prompt has closed wait a minute or so for the rest of the setup to get done, then in Chrome, navigate to the URL: http://localhost:8888


You should now see the Common Good Payment login screen.  If you don't see anything, press and pull upward on the page (the scroll bar is hidden because the primary usage of the app is on the phone).
